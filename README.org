* Scenario                                                             :20s:

Ray and Cameron have been collaborating for years on theoretical
biology research.  In a typical project, they might use Maxima to make
symbolic calculations and Julia for simulations.

Their work combines biology, physics, and computer science.

- E.g., Latest work-in-progress is on branching processes for cancer
  modelling.
* The problem                                                          :20s:

- Moving code and data between different programs by hand.
- Separate workflows for writing notes and preparing publications.
- This is time consuming and error prone!
* Possible solutions                                                   :20s:

Cameron is experienced with Jupyter and...

- Script of Scripts (https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/) partially
  solves /some/ of the problems.

Joe and Ray were happy explore Emacs-based solutions.
(And Cameron got enthusiastic about Doom Emacs!)

* Emacs+Org Mode...                                                     :1m:

* Naive calculation, using Maxima mode                                  :1m:

*Maxima doesn’t have a long-running process by default!* Here’s a *“partridge in a pear tree”* workaround.
#+begin_example
⌗+NAME: solve-for-u0
⌗+BEGIN_SRC maxima :results raw
tex(u0sol : part(solve ([u/(D*u + s) = %e^(-s*v) * u0/(D*u0 + s)], [u0]), 1 , 2));
⌗+END_SRC
#+end_example
#+RESULTS: solve-for-u0
$$-{{s\,u\,e^{s\,v}}\over{D\,u\,e^{s\,v}-D\,u-s}}$$
#+NAME: check-characteristic-u
#+begin_example
⌗+BEGIN_SRC maxima :results raw :noweb yes
<<solve-for-u>>
tex(factor(diff(usol, v) + usol*(D*usol + s)));
⌗+END_SRC
#+end_example
#+RESULTS: check-characteristic-u
$${{s\,u_{0}}\over{\left(D\,u_{0}+s\right)\,e^{s\,v}-D\,u_{0}}}$$
$$0$$

* Problem 1: passing variables and outputs! — Org mode can do this      :1m:

(Actually, perhaps it’s a bit easier than the naive attempt suggests.)

#+begin_example
⌗+name: block-1
⌗+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :cache yes :results raw
(current-time-string)
⌗+END_SRC

⌗+RESULTS[8dfa404531eb9e20742feb333c9031cd519de5ce]: block-1
Fri Nov 27 19:17:23 2020

⌗+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw :var input=block-1 :noweb yes
(format "Then %S and now: %S" <<block-1>> input)
⌗+END_SRC

⌗+RESULTS:
Then "Fri Nov 27 19:18:26 2020" and now: "Fri Nov 27 19:17:23 2020
"
#+end_example

* Problem 2: Making the process long running                            :3m:
** Solution: access maxima via a new “ob-servant” facility

#+begin_src exp :servant maxima-proc :results output org
display2d:false
#+end_src
#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src org
false
#+end_src

#+begin_src exp :servant maxima-proc :results output raw
expand((x+1)^9)
#+end_src
#+RESULTS:
$$x^9+9\,x^8+36\,x^7+84\,x^6+126\,x^5+126\,x^4+84\,x^3+36\,x^2+9\,x+1$$

(*Bonus feature*: we made it do tex output by default.)

** Minor change to ob-core.el

We added a =:servant= parameter to override =org-babel-execute:<lang>=
inside =org-babel-execute-src-block=.  (We still want to keep the
language around to control fontification etc.)

#+begin_src diff
715c715,719
< 		 (cmd (intern (concat "org-babel-execute:" lang)))
---
> 		 ;; OVERRIDE WITH :stream TO ACCESS THE PROCESS WE CALL
> 		 ;; e.g. (:stream . "calculator")
> 		 (cmd (if (assoc :servant params)
> 			#'org-babel-servant
> 			(intern (concat "org-babel-execute:" lang))))
#+end_src

** Quick overview of ob-servant.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-babel-servant-info nil)     ;; A hash table storing :preproc, :postproc etc., per service
(defun org-babel-servant-setup () ... )
(defun org-babel-servant-callback (prc str) ... )
(defun org-babel-servant-error-callback (prc str) ... )
(defun org-babel-servant (body params)
      ;; ① Extract the process from the param list.
      ;; ② Preprocess the body if possible.
      ;; ③ Set the timeout.
      ;; ④ Should make sure we really have a process before proceeding further!
      ;; ⑤ Clear the last output.  Later on, we might want to allow the
      ;;    option of archiving the old output for safe keeping. (Like McCarthy Elephant 2000?)
      ;; ⑥ Record the time
      ;; ⑦ Send out a request to the program we’re calling
      ;; ⑧ Wait for the replies... 
      ;; ⑨ Coda for post-processing (when required)
)
#+end_src

** Example set up

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(get-buffer-create "maxima-error")
(setq maxima-proc
      (make-process
       :name "maxima-proc"
       :command '("maxima" "--very-quiet") 
       :stderr "maxima-error"
       :filter #'org-babel-servant-callback))

(puthash '("maxima-proc" :preproc) (lambda (x params) (concat x "\n"))           org-babel-servant-info)
(puthash '("maxima-proc" :preproc) (lambda (x params) (concat "tex(" x ");\n"))  org-babel-servant-info)
(puthash '("maxima-proc" :postproc) (lambda (x params err) (substring x nil -6)) org-babel-servant-info)
(puthash '("maxima-proc" :timeout) 2.0                                           org-babel-servant-info)
(gethash '("maxima-proc" :lastout)                                               org-babel-servant-info)
#+end_src

* Reflections: pleasure and pain!                                      :30s:

1. Getting *emacs-juypter* working via TRAMP not resolved ([[https://github.com/nnicandro/emacs-jupyter/issues/191][#191]])!     :-(

2. Working on ob-servant was pretty fun!                            *:-)*

3. We got more experience with co-editing code                      *:-)*

4. The stack is work in progress (e.g. crdt.el bugfixes thanks to
   Qiantan).                                                        *:-)*

5. A few small *compatibility issues* came up with /Firn/ and /Logseq/
   (these were addressed by the maintainers quickly!)               *:-)*

6. We tried getting Emacs running in the browser to make these tools
   widely accessible — but command keys didn’t pass through properly
   on the most popular browsers.                                    :-(

7. We got benefit from presenting early prototypes at Emacs NYC     *:-)*

8. Dialogues continue around EmacsConf 2020 w/ Fermin and others    *:-)*

* Future work 1                                                         :30s:

- How to integrate this workflow with Arxana (EmacsConf 2013, FARM 2017)

- General idea of network programming, e.g., with string diagrams

- How do we think about “remote control” for long-running processes?

* Conclusions: we have taken steps to address:                         :30s:

** Reproducible research

- Something is "reproducible" if it is teachable to someone new!

- Org Mode (and literate programming in general) is useful for this.


** Interdisciplinary collaboration

- Collaboration across different skill sets is challenging.

- Our collaboration was already interdisciplinary...

• ... but what about collaborations between a scenario planner, a simulation scientist, and local farmers, etc.?

* Future work 2                                                        :30s:

** Science should be:

- Widely teachable
- Sharable
- Semi-automated
- Transdisciplinary
- Real-time, like EmacsConf!
